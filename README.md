# Snake Game

## Description:
Here I built a simple snake game using pygame. I built it while learning about the module. It used some complex logic but was simple to get up and running. One new thing I tried was a high score which was stored in a local txt file. It is a simple and fun game to play when you have the time.

## How to play:
The arrow keys are used to move around. The goal is to eat the apples (red squares) and grow longer. The length is shown in the bottom right of the screen. Try to beat the high score!
